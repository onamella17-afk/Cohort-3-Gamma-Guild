**Part 6: Transaction Analysis **
### Transaction Overview
[This transaction, demonstrates an NFT utility action on a network with extremely low gas fees (Layer 2 or Sidechain), contrasting sharply with Ethereum Mainnet costs.

Value & Fees (with comparison table)
This demonstrates the power of Layer 2/Sidechain optimization, as a complex action costs only pennies.

Technical Details
| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Method Called | Aggregated Transfer (Implies the contract called multiple token transfer functions). |
| Input Data Analysis | Data instructed the contract to handle 2 tokens simultaneously. |
| Tokens Transferred | 2 ERC-721 Tokens (Otherdeed for Otherside) |
| Transfer Details | From: kach005.eth To: Null: 0x000...000 (Implies burning, staking, or locking the NFTs permanently into a smart contract vault). |
| Events Emitted | Multiple Transfer events confirming the movement of NFTs out of the user's control. |
Analysis & Insights
This was a user executing a complex utility function on two NFTs (). The transfer to the Null Address (0x000...) strongly suggests the user was burning, staking, or irrevocably locking the NFTs as part of a larger ecosystem mechanic (e.g., in exchange for a new token or an upgraded asset).
 The gas price was Extremely reasonable. A $0.02 fee for an Aggregated Transfer of two NFTs confirms this transaction occurred on an optimized Layer 2 or Sidechain. This is the ideal cost structure for Web3 mass adoption.
 The sender couldn’t have saved the gas. The fee is negligible. The sender (kach005.eth) likely chose this network specifically to take advantage of these minimal costs, prioritizing efficiency over the congestion of Ethereum Mainnet.
 Key Lesson: This transaction is a powerful demonstration of Gas Optimization (Part 4): complex, multi-token interactions that would cost $10–$50 on Ethereum Mainnet can be executed for pennies on scaling solutions, making utility and experimentation accessible.
